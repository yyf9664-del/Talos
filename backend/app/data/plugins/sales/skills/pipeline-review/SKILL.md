## What I Need From You

**Option A: Upload a CSV**
Export your pipeline from your CRM (e.g. Salesforce, HubSpot). Helpful fields:
- Deal/Opportunity name
- Account name
- Amount
- Stage
- Close date
- Created date
- Last activity date
- Owner (if reviewing a team)
- Primary contact

**Option B: Paste your deals**
```
Acme Corp - $50K - Negotiation - closes Jan 31 - last activity Jan 20
TechStart - $25K - Demo scheduled - closes Feb 15 - no activity in 3 weeks
BigCo - $100K - Discovery - closes Mar 30 - created last week
```

**Option C: Describe your pipeline**
"I have 12 deals. Two big ones in negotiation that I'm confident about. Three stuck in discovery for over a month. The rest are mid-stage but I haven't talked to some of them in a while."

## Deals to Consider Removing

These deals may be dead weight:

| Deal | Amount | Reason | Recommendation |
|------|--------|--------|----------------|
| [Deal] | $[X] | [No activity 60+ days, no response] | Mark closed-lost |
| [Deal] | $[X] | [Pushed 3+ times, no champion] | Qualify out |
```

---

## Prioritization Framework

I'll rank your deals using this framework:

| Factor | Weight | What I Look For |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| **Close Date** | 30% | Deals closing soonest get priority |
| **Deal Size** | 25% | Bigger deals = more focus |
| **Stage** | 20% | Later stage = more focus |
| **Activity** | 15% | Active deals get prioritized |
| **Risk** | 10% | Lower risk = safer bet |

You can tell me to weight differently: "Focus on big deals over soon deals" or "I need quick wins, prioritize close dates."

## Tips

1. **Review weekly** — Pipeline health decays fast. Weekly reviews catch issues early.
2. **Kill dead deals** — Stale opportunities inflate your pipeline and distort forecasts. Be ruthless.
3. **Multi-thread everything** — If one person goes dark, you need a backup contact.
4. **Close dates should mean something** — A close date is when you expect signature, not when you hope for one.
