## Example Workflows

### Drafting a Blog Post

```
> /draft-content
Type: blog post
Topic: How AI is transforming B2B marketing
Audience: Marketing directors at mid-market SaaS companies
Key messages: AI saves time on repetitive tasks, improves personalization, requires human oversight
Tone: Authoritative but approachable
Length: 1200 words
```

Claude will generate a structured blog post draft with an engaging headline, introduction with a hook, organized sections, SEO-optimized subheadings, and a clear call to action.

### Planning a Campaign

```
> /campaign-plan
Goal: Drive 500 signups for our new product launch
Audience: Technical decision-makers at enterprise companies
Timeline: 6 weeks
Budget range: $20,000-$30,000
```

Claude will produce a campaign brief covering objectives, audience segmentation, key messages, channel strategy, a week-by-week content calendar, and KPIs to track.

### Reviewing Content Against Brand Guidelines

```
> /brand-review
[paste your draft content]
```

If your brand style guide is configured in local settings, Claude will check your content against voice, tone, terminology, and messaging pillars. If not configured, Claude will ask about your guidelines or provide a generic review for clarity, consistency, and professionalism.

## Configuration

Configure your brand voice, style guide, and target personas in a local settings file for personalized output. This allows commands like `/draft-content` and `/brand-review` to automatically apply your brand standards without prompting each time.
